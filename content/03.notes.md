## Notes on cytokine biology
1. CXCR4
- "CXCR-4 is an alpha-chemokine receptor specific for stromal-derived-factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12), which has been found to be expressed in more than 23 different types of cancers. Recently, the SDF-1/CXCR-4 signaling pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for human tumor because of its critical role in tumor initiation and progression by activating multiple signaling pathways, such as ERK1/2, ras, p38 MAPK, PLC/ MAPK, and SAPK/ JNK, as well as regulating cancer stem cells" [review: @pubmed:28875842]
