    "abstract": "The tumor-associated-Ag MART-1 is expressed by most human melanomas. The genes encoding an alphabeta TCR from a MART-1-specific, HLA-A2-restricted, human T cell clone have been efficiently transferred and expressed in human PBL. These retrovirally transduced PBL cultures were MART-1 peptide reactive, and most cultures recognized HLA-A2+ melanoma lines. Limiting dilution clones were generated from three bulk transduced PBL cultures to investigate the function of individual clones within the transduced cultures. Twenty-nine of 29 CD8+ clones specifically secreted IFN-gamma in response to T2 cells pulsed with MART-1(27-35) peptide, and 23 of 29 specifically secreted IFN-gamma in response to HLA-A2+ melanoma lines. Additionally, 23 of 29 CD8+ clones lysed T2 cells pulsed with the MART-1(27-35) peptide and 15 of 29 lysed the HLA-A2+ melanoma line 888. CD4+ clones specifically secreted IFN-gamma in response to T2 cells pulsed with the MART-1(27-35) peptide. TCR gene transfer to patient PBL can produce CTL with anti-tumor reactivity in vitro and could potentially offer a treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. This approach could also be applied to the treatment of other tumors and viral infections. Additionally, TCR gene transfer offers unique opportunities to study the fate of adoptively transferred T cells in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The expression of immunoglobulin-based artificial receptors in normal T lymphocytes provides a means to target lymphocytes to cell surface antigens independently of major histocompatibility complex restriction. Such artificial receptors have been previously shown to confer antigen-specific tumoricidal properties in murine T cells. We constructed a novel zeta chain fusion receptor specific for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) termed Pz-1. PSMA is a cell-surface glycoprotein expressed on prostate cancer cells and the neovascular endothelium of multiple carcinomas. We show that primary T cells harvested from five of five patients with different stages of prostate cancer and transduced with the Pz-1 receptor readily lyse prostate cancer cells. Having established a culture system using fibroblasts that express PSMA, we next show that T cells expressing the Pz-1 receptor release cytokines in response to cell-bound PSMA. Furthermore, we show that the cytokine release is greatly augmented by B7.1-mediated costimulation. Thus, our findings support the feasibility of adoptive cell therapy by using genetically engineered T cells in prostate cancer patients and suggest that both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte functions can be synergistically targeted against tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "We identified a tumor-associated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope derived from the widely expressed human MDM2 oncoprotein and were able to bypass self-tolerance to this tumor antigen in HLA-A*0201 (A2.1) transgenic mice and by generating A2.1-negative, allo-A2.1-restricted human T lymphocytes. A broad range of malignant, as opposed to nontransformed cells, were killed by high-avidity transgenic mouse and allogeneic human CTLs specific for the A2.1-presented MDM2 epitope. Whereas the self-A2.1-restricted human T cell repertoire gave rise only to low-avidity CTLs unable to recognize the natural MDM2 peptide, human A2.1+ T lymphocytes were turned into efficient MDM2-specific CTLs upon expression of wild-type and partially humanized high-affinity T cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes derived from the transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that TCR gene transfer can be used to circumvent self-tolerance of autologous T lymphocytes to universal tumor antigens and thus provide the basis for a TCR gene transfer-based broad-spectrum immunotherapy of malignant disease.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genome sequencing has enabled the rapid identification of the complete repertoire of coding sequence mutations within a patient's tumor and facilitated their use as personalized immunogens. Although a variety of techniques are available to assist in the selection of mutation-defined epitopes to be included within the tumor vaccine, the ability of the peptide to bind to patient MHC is a key gateway to peptide presentation. With advances in the accuracy of predictive algorithms for MHC class I binding, choosing epitopes on the basis of predicted affinity provides a rapid and unbiased approach to epitope prioritization. We show herein the retrospective application of a prediction algorithm to a large set of bona fide T cell-defined mutated human tumor antigens that induced immune responses, most of which were associated with tumor regression or long-term disease stability. The results support the application of this approach for epitope selection and reveal informative features of these naturally occurring epitopes to aid in epitope prioritization for use in tumor vaccines.",

Given the clinical successes of immune checkpoint modulators, interest in cancer vaccines as therapeutic options has been revived. Current data suggest that each tumor contains a unique set of mutations (mutanome), thus requiring the creation of individualized cancer vaccines. However, rigorous analysis of non-individualized cancer immunotherapy approaches across multiple cancer types and in the context of known driver alterations has yet to be reported. We therefore set out to determine the feasibility of a generalizable cancer vaccine strategy based on targeting multiple neoantigens in an HLA-A/B subtype-directed manner.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, the process of immunoediting early in tumorigenesis remains obscure. Here, we employ a mathematical model that utilizes the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to elucidate the contribution of individual mutations and HLA alleles to the immunoediting process. We find that common cancer mutations including BRAF-V600E and KRAS-G12D are predicted to bind none of the common HLA alleles, and are thus \"immunogenically silent\" in the human population. We identify regions of proteins that are not presented by HLA at a population scale, coinciding with frequently mutated hotspots in cancer, and other protein regions broadly presented across the population in which few mutations occur. We also find that 9/29 common HLA alleles contribute disproportionately to the immunoediting of early oncogenic mutations. These data provide insights into immune evasion of common driver mutations and a molecular basis for the association of particular HLA genotypes with cancer susceptibility.",
